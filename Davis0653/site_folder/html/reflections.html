<p>
When I began CIS241 in Fall 2018, I had zero experience with Web Design. I didn’t know what HTML, CSS, or Mark-Up Language meant. At first I was slightly intimidated, but I was always excited.
</p>
<p>I remember how that excitement grew and the apprehension quickly changed into exuberance as I learned about HTML and how it worked with CSS. It impressed me how smoothly and beautifully the two languages work together. The languages are well designed and the syntax seems very obvious. It was a similar experience to when I began learning PowerShell for my Networking degree. If there is something you don’t quite know, you can try what seems like it should be the answer and it is usually correct or very close. I am grateful that I was lucky enough to begin after HTML5 was released because I don’t think I would have been as impressed with previous versions.
</p>
<p>
After only one quarter of Web Development, I am very excited to learn more. I feel like I have found the area of CIS that I enjoy the most, have some aptitude for, and would like to make a career out of.

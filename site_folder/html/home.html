 <h1 class="intro">Welcome to my Web Page</h1>
<article>
<p>My name is Scott Thomas Davis. I am in my second year at Edmonds Community College where I am learning Networking and Web Design. I am working towards associate degrees in both Web Development/Application Specialist and Network Technology. Setting up networks can be fun and challenging, but I am especially enjoying learning new programming and markup languages.</p>
	<p>When I am not studying Computer Information Systems, I am usually spending time with my best friend, a miniature Australian Shepard named Shu, playing classical guitar, or passing time playing video games. I am currently playing Fallout 4, Destiny 2, Metro 2033 redux, and soon will be playing Fallout 76.</p>
	<p>My professional goal is to either be self employed as a Web Developer/Designer or to work for a small company as a combination Web Designer and IT person. I am working to gain a unique and broad skill-set that would make my services extremely valuable and useful for a small company.</p>
	<p>As a personal goal, I want to use the income from my Web Development work to start a non profit aimed at helping both homeless people and abandoned dogs find a safe place to recover. I have a very unique background that makes me uniquely qualified to understand and help a segment of the population that is currently struggling and to also bring awareness to the problem of homelessness to people who might not think it affects them or that they can't do anything to help. I believe homelessness is all of our problem and it is everyone's duty to help find a solution.</p>
